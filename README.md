# Estructuras Arquitectonicas



## 1. Objective

The objective of the first delivery of the project is to build a **vertical prototype** of a software system, based on an **initial architectural design**.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Functional Requirements

* The domain and the functional approach for the software system must be defined by the team.
* The functional scope of the prototype must be defined by the team.

### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements

* The software system must follow a **distributed** architecture.
* The software system must include at least one **presentation**-type **component** (a web front-end).
* The software system must include a set of **logic**-type **components**.
* The software system must include a set of **data**-type **components** (a relational database and a NoSQL database).
* The software system must include at least two different types of **HTTP**-based **connectors**.
* The software system must be built using at least two different general-purpose programming languages.
* The deployment of the software system must be **container**-oriented.
